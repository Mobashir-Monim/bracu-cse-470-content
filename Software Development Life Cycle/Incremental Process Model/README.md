# Incremental Process Model

The Incremental Process Model is an **Evolutionary** process model of software development where a large project is broken down into smaller, manageable parts called "increments." Each increment represents a portion of the overall project's functionality. Instead of building the entire software system all at once, the project is developed incrementally, one piece at a time, with each increment adding new features or improving existing ones.

The Incremental Process Model is like building a big LEGO castle step by step. Here's what it means:

1. **Start Small**: First, you build just a part of the castle, like the walls and towers.

2. **Add More**: Then, you add new things in small steps, like a drawbridge, a moat, or a kitchen inside the castle.

3. **Test and Play**: After each step, you make sure that what you built works well and is fun to play with.

4. **Keep Going**: You keep adding more and more to your castle, like bedrooms, flags, and other cool stuff.

5. **Finished Castle**: In the end, you have a big and awesome LEGO castle with everything you wanted!

So, the Incremental Process Model is like building something big by doing a little bit at a time, making sure each part works, and then adding more until you have something amazing, just like building your LEGO castle!
