# Disadvantages of Incremental process model

Imagine you have a big coloring book, and you want to color a picture of a cute puppy. The Incremental Process Model is like coloring the puppy picture one part at a time. Here are some not-so-good things about coloring this way:

---

1. **Not Finished Quickly**: It takes more time to finish your whole picture because you color one part at a time.

2. **Can Get Messy**: Sometimes, when you color one part, you might accidentally color outside the lines, and it's tricky to fix.

3. **Hard to Change**: If you decide you want the puppy to have a different color later, it can be hard to change it because you already colored some parts.

4. **Lots of Checking**: You have to check your picture a lot to make sure it looks nice, which can be a little tiring.

So, the Incremental Process Model is like coloring your puppy picture step by step, which can take more time, and you need to be extra careful not to make mistakes. Just like when you're coloring in your coloring book!
