# Advantages of Waterfall

Imagine you have a big coloring book. The Waterfall way is like coloring one page at a time, and you finish each page before you start a new one. Here are the good things about coloring this way:

---

1. **One Thing at a Time**: You don't get mixed up. You finish coloring one picture before you start the next one.

2. **Neat and Tidy**: Your coloring stays nice and neat because you're not jumping around between pages.

3. **Easy to Check**: You can see if you colored everything right because you're done with one page before moving on.

4. **No Surprises**: You know what the picture will look like when you're done because you planned it at the beginning.

So, the Waterfall way is good for projects because it helps you do one thing at a time, keeps your work neat, and lets you know what to expect when you're finished. Just like coloring in your coloring book!
