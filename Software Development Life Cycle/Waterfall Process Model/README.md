# Waterfall Process Model

The Waterfall Model is a **sequential** approach to software development that divides the project into distinct phases, with each phase building upon the results of the previous one. It is one of the earliest and most traditional software development life cycle models. In the Waterfall model, progress flows in a single direction, much like water cascading down a waterfall, with no phase overlapping or starting until the preceding phase is complete.

Imagine we're building a big tower using building blocks. The Waterfall process is like building our tower one block at a time, and we can't put on a new block until we finish the one below it.

So, first, we need to understand how our tower should look like, just like when we plan a big puzzle. This is called the "Requirement Gathering" phase.

After that we think about all the blocks we need and how they should fit together to make the tower according to what was described in the previous step. This is call "Requirement Analysis and Planning"

Next, we start building our tower by putting the blocks on top of each other, one by one. This is called the "Design" and "Implementation" phases. It's like following the picture on a puzzle box to put the pieces together.

After we've finished putting all the blocks together, we check to make sure our tower is strong and doesn't fall down. This is the "Testing" phase, where we see if everything works like it should.

If our tower is strong and looks just like we planned, we can say, "Yay, it's ready!" and use it for whatever we needed it for. This is the "Deployment" phase, where we start using what we built.

Finally, we need to hand over the tower to the client and explain to them how the tower works. This is the "Delivery" phase.

So, the Waterfall process is like building a tower step by step, making sure each step is finished before we move on to the next one. Just like how we finish one puzzle piece before starting the next one, and we can never go back to working on any of the previous steps once we are done with it.
