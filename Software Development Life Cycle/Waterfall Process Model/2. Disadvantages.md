# Disadvantage of Waterfall

Imagine you have a big tower of building blocks, like in a tower game. The Waterfall way is like building the tower one block at a time, and you can't change a block once you put it in. Here are the not-so-good things about building this way:

---

1. **No Going Back**: If you make a mistake with a block, you can't fix it easily. It's like when you draw on your coloring book with a crayon, and you can't erase it.

2. **Waiting a Long Time**: You have to wait until the tower is all finished before you can play with it. It's like waiting for your cake to bake before you can eat it.

3. **Surprises at the End**: Sometimes, when you finally finish the tower, you might realize it doesn't look how you wanted. It's like when you open a present, and it's not what you expected.

4. **Can't Change Your Mind**: If you want to add something new or change your tower, it's tricky because you already finished it. It's like trying to add more colors to a picture after you colored it all.

So, the Waterfall way is not so good when you want to fix things easily, play with your tower quickly, or make changes along the way. It's like once you build the tower, it's hard to change it. Just like when you color outside the lines in your coloring book!
