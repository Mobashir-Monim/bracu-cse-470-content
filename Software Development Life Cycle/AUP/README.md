# Agile Unified Process (AUP)

The term "Agile Unified Process" (AUP) is a bit of a misnomer, as it combines elements of two separate software development approaches: "Agile" and the "Unified Process" (UP). Break down of both concepts:

1. **Agile**: Agile is a set of principles and values for software development that prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Agile methodologies, like Scrum and Kanban, advocate iterative and incremental development, welcoming changing requirements, and delivering working software in short cycles.

2. **Unified Process (UP)**: The Unified Process is a software development framework that focuses on architecture, design, and documentation. It defines a set of phases, workflows, and artifacts to guide the development process. It is often associated with the Rational Unified Process (RUP), which is a specific implementation of UP.

The term "Agile Unified Process" is typically used to describe an approach that combines the principles of Agile methodologies with the structure and discipline of the Unified Process. It's an attempt to strike a balance between the flexibility and customer-centric nature of Agile and the rigor and documentation of the Unified Process.

AUP posesses four phases during which seven different tasks are performed. Depending on the phase, the intensity of each task is different.

The four phases of AUP are:

1. **Inception**: The beginning of the project
2. **Elaboration**: The amalgamation of "Requirement Collection" and "Requirement Analysis" phases from SDLC
3. **Construction**: The amalgamation of "Implementation" and "Testing" phases from SDLC
4. **Transition**: The ultimate delivery phase from SDLC

The seven tasks of AUP are:

1. **Model**: This task focuses on the development of the software architecture and design
2. **Implementation**: This task focuses on the actual development of the software
3. **Test**: This task focuses on the testing of the written code
4. **Deployment**: This task focuses on the "launch" of the written code
5. **Configuration Management**: This task focuses on the management of the "environment" in which the written code is ran
6. **Project Management**: This task focuses ensuring that all other tasks are being performed as necessary
7. **Environment**: This task focuses on understanding and defining the parameters of the "environment" in which the written code will be working

Imagine you're building a big LEGO castle. The "Agile Unified Process" is like a special way to build it:

1. **Little Steps**: Instead of building the whole castle at once, you start with small parts, like the walls or towers.

2. **Checking and Fixing**: After each small part, you check to make sure it's strong and looks good. If something's not right, you can fix it.

3. **Changing if Needed**: You can change your castle as you go if you think of a better way to build it.

4. **Making Plans**: Sometimes, you draw a plan to see how your castle will look when it's finished.

5. **Working Together**: You can build with your friends, and everyone helps make the castle strong and cool.

So, the "Agile Unified Process" is like building your LEGO castle step by step, making sure it's strong and pretty, changing it if you want, and having fun with your friends while building it!
