# Advantages of AUP

---

1. **Friends Help**: Just like when you build with your friends, AUP encourages teamwork. Everyone works together, which can make things easier.

2. **Try, Try Again**: AUP lets you try things out and change them if they don't work. It's like trying different colors when you draw, and if you don't like one, you can use a different crayon.

3. **Show and Tell**: You get to show what you've built to others and ask if they like it. This way, you make sure you're making something everyone will enjoy, like showing your LEGO creation to your family.

4. **Fixing Mistakes**: If you make a mistake, AUP helps you fix it quickly, just like erasing a wrong line when you draw.

5. **Happy Customers**: AUP is great for making customers happy because you can give them parts of what you're making early, and they can tell you what they like or want to change.

So, with AUP, it's like building, drawing, or playing with your friends. You try things, make them better, show them to others, fix mistakes, and make everyone happy!
