2. **Can Be Confusing**: AUP can be a little confusing because it has many steps and rules. It's like trying to learn a new game with lots of rules.

3. **Takes Time**: AUP can take more time because you have to plan, change things, and show them to others. It's like spending extra time on your homework when you'd rather be playing.

4. **Not Always Flexible**: AUP can be strict about following certain steps, so it's not as flexible as just playing freely. It's like having to follow the rules in a board game.
