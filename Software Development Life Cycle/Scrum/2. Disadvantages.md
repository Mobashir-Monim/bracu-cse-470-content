# Disadvantages of Scrum

---

1. **Lots of Talking**: Sometimes, you have to talk a lot with your friends and team, and it can take a long time. It's like talking about the rules of a game before you can start playing.

2. **Waiting for Turns**: In Scrum, you take turns, and you might have to wait for your turn to do something. It's like waiting for your friend to finish their turn on the swing at the playground.

3. **Not Always Easy**: Scrum can be a bit hard because you have to follow the rules, and if you make a mistake, it can be tricky to fix. It's like trying to solve a puzzle that's really challenging.

4. **Lots of Planning**: Sometimes, you spend a lot of time making plans and talking about what you'll do instead of doing the actual project. It's like planning a big picnic but not getting to eat right away.

5. **Not for Everything**: Scrum works well for some things, like building cool LEGO sets, but it might not work for everything. Some projects need a different way of working.

So, while Scrum can be great for teamwork and making plans, it can also be a bit talkative, require patience, and sometimes not be the best fit for every project.
