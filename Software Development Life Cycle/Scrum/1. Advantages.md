# Advantages of Scrum

---

1. **Teamwork**: Scrum helps you work with your friends on a project, like building a cool LEGO tower together. Everyone helps, and it's fun!

2. **Short Goals**: It's like playing a game with small goals. You finish one goal quickly, and then you celebrate, like scoring a point in a game.

3. **Fixing Mistakes**: If something doesn't work, you can fix it easily because you check your progress often. It's like erasing a wrong line when you draw.

4. **Happy Customers**: Scrum makes the people who want your project (like your parents or teacher) really happy because they get to see parts of it quickly.

5. **Having a Plan**: It's like having a treasure map that shows you the way. You always know what you're doing next.

So, with Scrum, you and your friends work together, set small goals, fix things easily, make people happy, and follow a map to success!
