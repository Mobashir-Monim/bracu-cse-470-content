# Advantages of V-model

Imagine you have a special way to build a super cool tower with building blocks, like Legos. The V-Model has some good things about it, just like when you play with your Legos:

---

1. **Strong Tower**: It helps you make sure your tower is really strong and won't fall down because you check it carefully as you build it.

2. **No Surprises**: You know exactly how your tower will look when you finish because you planned it at the beginning. No surprises!

3. **Testing Fun**: You get to test each part of your tower as you go, like making sure every Lego block fits perfectly. It's like playing and checking at the same time!

4. **Fixing Early**: If you find a problem with one of your Lego blocks, you can fix it right away. It's like if you see a broken toy, you can try to fix it before it gets worse.
