# V-Model

The V-Model is a software development and testing methodology that extends the Waterfall model. It's called the "V-Model" because its development and testing phases are represented as two arms of a "V" shape, with a strong emphasis on the relationship between development and testing activities. Like waterfall, V-model is also a **Sequential** process model.

Imagine we're building a big tower using building blocks. The Waterfall process is like building our tower one block at a time, and we can't put on a new block until we finish the one below it.

So, first, we need to understand how our tower should look like, just like when we plan a big puzzle. This is called the "Requirement Gathering" phase.
After collecting the infromation, we validate if the information collected is correct or not.

After that we think about all the blocks we need and how they should fit together to make the tower according to what was described in the previous step. This is call "Requirement Analysis and Planning".
Then we validate if the analysis and the planning is proper or not.

Next, we start building our tower by putting the blocks on top of each other, one by one. This is called the "Design" and "Implementation" phases. It's like following the picture on a puzzle box to put the pieces together.

After we've finished putting all the blocks together, we check to make sure our tower is strong and doesn't fall down. This is the "Testing" phase, where we see if everything works like it should. This is validating the "Implementation" phase

If our tower is strong and looks just like we planned, we can say, "Yay, it's ready!" and use it for whatever we needed it for. This is the "Deployment" phase, where we start using what we built.
Then we validate if the deployed solution is working properly or not.

Finally, we need to hand over the tower to the client and explain to them how the tower works. This is the "Delivery" phase.
This is where we validate again if the software is acceptable to the client.

So, the V-Model is like building your tower and checking it at the same time, making sure it's strong and looks just like you planned. It's a good way to make sure your tower is awesome!
