# Example of Incremental process model

**Scenario:**

Imagine you're part of a team tasked with creating a brand new mobile app. This app will help people plan their vacations by providing information about travel destinations, booking flights and accommodations, and suggesting activities and restaurants.

**Why the Iterative Process Model is Ideal**:

1. **Starting with a Basic App (First Iteration)**:

    - In the first iteration, the team develops a basic version of the app. It allows users to search for travel destinations and view basic information about them. It's like building the foundation of a sandcastle.

2. **Feedback from Early Users**:

    - The team releases the basic app to a small group of users who are interested in vacation planning. Users provide feedback on what they like and what's missing.

3. **Adding More Features (Second Iteration)**:

    - Based on the feedback, the team decides to add more features in the second iteration. They include the ability to book flights and accommodations, as well as to save favorite destinations.

4. **Continuous Testing and User Feedback**:

    - After each iteration, the team thoroughly tests the app to make sure everything works smoothly. They also gather feedback from users to understand their needs and preferences.

5. **Enhancing User Experience (Third Iteration)**:

    - In the third iteration, the team focuses on improving the user interface and making the app more user-friendly. They also add features like suggesting activities and restaurants at the chosen destinations.

6. **Testing and Feedback Loop (Ongoing Iterations)**:

    - The team continues to release new iterations, each with enhancements and improvements. They keep testing and getting feedback from users to make the app better.

7. **Stability and Performance (Later Iterations)**:

    - In the later iterations, the team works on optimizing the app's performance and ensuring it works smoothly on various devices and operating systems.

8. **Regular Updates (Maintenance and Post-Launch)**:
    - Even after the app is officially launched, the team keeps using the Iterative Process Model for regular updates. They add new features, fix bugs, and respond to user feedback to keep the app up-to-date and enjoyable.

So, in this scenario, the Iterative Process Model is ideal because it allows the team to create a mobile app that gets better and better with each iteration. Users' feedback helps shape the app to meet their vacation planning needs, ensuring it's user-friendly, functional, and enjoyable to use.
