Sure! So, think of the Iterative Process Model like making a yummy pizza.

1. First, You Make a Simple Pizza: You start by making a very basic pizza with just dough and tomato sauce. It's simple but not very tasty yet.

2. Next, You Add Toppings: In each round, you add different yummy toppings like cheese, pepperoni, and mushrooms to make the pizza better.

3. Taste and Ask Friends: After each round, you taste the pizza and ask your friends if they like it. They might say, "Needs more cheese!" or "Make it spicier!"

4. Keep Making it Better: You keep doing these rounds, adding more toppings and making the pizza tastier each time based on what your friends say.

5. Finish with a Delicious Pizza: When your pizza is super delicious and everyone loves it, you share it with everyone and have a pizza party!
