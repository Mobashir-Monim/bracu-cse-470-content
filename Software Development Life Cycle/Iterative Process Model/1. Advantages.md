# Advantages of Iterative process model

So, here are some good things about the Iterative Process Model, just like when you play with your favorite toys:

---

1. **Fixing Mistakes**: If you make a mistake while building something, it's easier to fix because you're not done with everything yet. It's like erasing a wrong line when you're drawing.

2. **Try New Things**: You can try out new ideas and see if they work. If you don't like it, you can change it without a big problem. It's like playing with different colors in your coloring book.

3. **Feedback Helps**: You can ask your friends or users what they think about what you're making. If they have good ideas, you can use them to make your project even better, just like playing a game and getting tips from your friends.

4. **Useful Parts Early**: You get to use and enjoy some parts of what you're building even before it's all finished. It's like playing with a cool toy while you're still building the rest of it.

5. **Less Scary**: Sometimes, big projects can be a little scary, but when you break them into smaller parts, they feel easier to handle, like solving small puzzles instead of a giant one.

So, the Iterative Process Model is like building, drawing, or playing with your toys one step at a time, fixing things easily, trying new stuff, and getting help from friends to make it super awesome!
