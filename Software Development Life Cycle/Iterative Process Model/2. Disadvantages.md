# Disadvantages of Iterative process model

Just like sometimes your favorite game or toy can have some not-so-fun parts, the Iterative Process Model has a few things that might not be so great:

---

1. **Takes More Time**: Since you have to keep going back and making things better, it can take more time to finish your project. It's like spending extra time on your homework when you'd rather be playing.

2. **Can Get Confusing**: With all the changes and improvements, things can get a little confusing. It's like when you're playing with a big pile of toys, and it's hard to find the one you want.

3. **Needs Good Planning**: You have to plan really well and keep track of all the changes, or you might forget what you're doing. It's like making sure you remember all the rules of your favorite game.

4. **Not Always Predictable**: Sometimes, you might not be sure when your project will be completely finished because you keep making it better. It's like not knowing when your bedtime is because it keeps changing.

5. **Can Be Tiring**: Working on the same thing over and over to make it perfect can be a little tiring, like running around a lot when you play outside.

So, the Iterative Process Model is like making things better and better, but it can take more time, be a bit confusing, and you need to plan carefully. But in the end, it helps you make your project really awesome!
