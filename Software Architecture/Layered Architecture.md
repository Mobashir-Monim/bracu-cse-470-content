# Layered Architecture

Think of a layered architecture like a delicious sandwich with different layers of ingredients stacked on top of each other. Each layer in the sandwich serves a specific purpose, and they all come together to create a tasty and well-structured meal. Similarly, in software, a **layered architecture** is a design pattern where a computer program is organized into different layers or levels, each with its own role and responsibility.

Here's how it works:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This is like the top layer of the sandwichâ€”the bread and the toppings you see. It's where the user interacts with the software, like clicking buttons and seeing what's on the screen.

2. **Business Layer**: This layer is beneath the presentation layer, like the tasty fillings in a sandwich. It contains the rules and logic of the software, like what happens when you click a button.

3. **Persistence Layer**: This layer is like the bottom slice of bread in a sandwich. It handles all the data, like storing and retrieving information from databases.

4. **Database Layer**: This layer is is the storage layer of the software architecute, which is the database for the software.

Other than the four layers mentioned above, we can also have several *open* **service layers** in between these four layers which can serve a multitude of functions.

Here's why layered architecture is important:

-   **Organization**: It keeps things neat and tidy, just like how the layers of a sandwich are nicely stacked.

-   **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific job, so it's easier to understand and change one part without messing up the others.

-   **Flexibility**: You can change the filling (application layer) without changing the bread (presentation and data layers) of your sandwich.

So, layered architecture is like making a sandwich where each layer has its own role, making the whole thing tasty and easy to enjoy! In software, it helps keep everything organized and flexible.

### Advantages of Layered Architecture

1. **Easy to Understand**: It's like having a sandwich with clear layers. Each layer has a specific job, making it easier to understand what each part does.

2. **Changes Are Safer**: If you want to change one layer, it's like changing the filling in a sandwich. You can do it without messing up the other layers.

3. **Teamwork**: Just like how different people can work on different parts of a sandwich, different teams can work on different layers of the software at the same time.

4. **Reusability**: It's like having a favorite sandwich filling that you can use in different sandwiches. You can reuse code or components in different parts of your software.

5. **Security**: Layers can act like protective wrappers in a sandwich. They can add security measures to keep your software safe.

So, layered architecture is like building a sandwich with clear layers, making it easier to understand, change, and work on different parts, while keeping everything tasty and secure!

### Disadvantages of Layered Architecture

1. **Complexity**: Just like too many layers in a sandwich can make it hard to eat, too many layers in software can make it complicated and harder to manage.

2. **Performance**: Sometimes, passing information between layers can be slow, like having to wait for the waiter to bring your order to the kitchen and back to your table.

3. **Rigidity**: If you want to change something in one layer, it can be like trying to change the filling in a sandwich without changing the bread. It might not always work well.

4. **Overhead**: Each layer adds a bit of extra work, like extra toppings in a sandwich. This can make the software slower or more resource-intensive.

5. **Not Always Needed**: For simple projects, having too many layers is like making a simple sandwich overly complex. It might not be necessary.

So, while layered architecture can help organize and protect your software, it can also make things more complex and slower, especially if you use too many layers for a simple project.
